# License-Plate-Recognition-with-Low-Light

### About The Project :

This project mainly aims at being able to detect license plates in low light. This application is built using MATLAB and GUI. An image is taken as input from the user and plate detection is performed on this image. The result is then presented to the user as text. Many image processing filters are used in the license plate detection phase of this application. In this way, it is aimed to give the most accurate result to the user. The application can now run stably and be used for improvements to be more flexible and optimized.
